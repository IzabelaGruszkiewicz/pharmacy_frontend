# Web application for pharmacy management

## Purpose of the project
The main objective of the project is to develop a web application with access to a database for managing a network of pharmacies. The goal of the application is to reduce the time it takes to order products from a pharmacy and to make the entire process transparent and intuitive. Users will be able to place orders, search for stationary pharmacies on an interactive map, add products to their favorites list, search for products, check available promotions and most frequently purchased products. After creating an account, users will be able to view basic account information and order history.
